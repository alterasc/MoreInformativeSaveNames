# More Informative Save Names mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous

Updates saving process and display save group name on loading screen

### When making a save instead of writing just main character name, writes the following string
```
CharacterName MainArchetype/MythicClass
```
I.e.:  
`Taolynn Cavalier/Azata` - if Cavalier is the class with highest amount of levels taken and Azata is the chosen mythic class

`Rix Sylvan Trickster` - if no mythic levels yet, and Rogue Sylvan Trickster is primary class

Note: this will apply only to saves made AFTER installing the mod. And WILL PERSIST after mod uninstall for those saves.

### Abbreviates campaign name

I.e. `IE` instead of Inevitable Excess, or `TLoN` instead of `The Lord of Nothing`
